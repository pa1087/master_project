# Django-Driven API Performance and Scalability with AWS EC2

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a scalable and high-performance REST API for managing car data using Django REST Framework. The API is deployed on AWS EC2 to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and optimal performance.

---

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete car data dynamically stored in a CSV file.
- **REST API Development**: Secure and efficient endpoints for car data management.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Scalable deployment on AWS EC2.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimized latency with optimized database queries and middleware.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Postman, JMeter, and RapidAPI.
- **API Monitoring**: Integrated AWS CloudWatch for performance tracking.

---

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Cloud**: AWS EC2, Elastic Beanstalk
- **Storage**: CSV file
- **Testing**: Postman, JMeter, RapidAPI
- **Frontend**: React.js (for API interaction)
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Deployment Steps

1. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS.
2. Configure inbound rules in the security group to allow HTTP traffic on port 8000.
3. SSH into the instance and set up the environment.
4. Clone this repository and install the required Python dependencies.
5. Start the Django development server.
6. Access the API through the EC2 public IP.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                          |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `/cars/`              | GET    | Retrieve all cars.                  |
| `/cars/search`        | GET    | Filter cars by make and year.       |
| `/cars/add`           | POST   | Add a new car.                      |
| `/cars/update/<id>`   | PUT    | Update car details by ID.           |
| `/cars/delete/<id>`   | DELETE | Delete a car by ID.                 |

---

## Testing

- **Postman**: Test each endpoint with various scenarios, including edge cases.
- **RapidAPI**: Publish the API for external testing and monitoring.
- **JMeter**: Load testing to validate performance under high traffic.

---

## Results

- Successfully deployed on AWS EC2 with seamless scalability.
- Verified API functionality and performance through rigorous testing.
- Clear and detailed documentation for developers and users.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Transition from CSV storage to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Implement advanced authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Add bulk operations and extended filtering capabilities.
- Enhance API analytics and logging.
